Hello, I have made a Machine Learning Project using Linear Regression
It is used to predict the medical insurance cost for a person

The input format is:
  Age
  Sex: 0 (For Male)
       1 (For Female)
  BMI
  Number of Children
  Smoker: 0 (For No)
          1 (For Yes)
  Any Body Issues: 0 (For No)
                   1 (For Yes)
  Region: 1 (For Southwest)
          2 (For Southeast)
          3 (For Northwest)
          4 (For Northeast)
          
Download the CSV file and then take the location of the file.
Add that location in the place of 'file' variable present in the medical-insurance-ml.ipynb file.
